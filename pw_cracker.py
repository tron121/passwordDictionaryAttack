# Passwords are in the format found in /etc/shadow: $[hash_algorithm_id]$[hash_salt]$[hash_data]
#
# This format optionally allows changing the number of rounds each hash function is applied:
# $[hash_algorithm_id]$rounds=[# of rounds]$[hash_salt]$[hash_data]
#
# For this program the salt is prepended to the password and is only applied in the
# first round. The input to the next round of hashing is a hex string of the previous hash digest.
#
# Hash algorithm IDs and default rounds:
# 1 MD5 (1000 rounds)
# 2 Blowfish (64 rounds)
# 5 SHA256 (5000 rounds)
# 6 SHA512 (5000 rounds)
# 

# return list of plaintext passwords in the same order as `passwords_from_file`
